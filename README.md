ML Approaches / challenges

to summarise, team suggested few areas that could be useful to explore with ML tools, ideas listed below:
* Noise detection
* Tilt detection
* Quality of the sensor (bad sensor) using metadata to come up with a better pass/fail
* Clockdrift correction using ML, build a clock drift model using the GNSSS on (ignore GNSS fixes to train the model)
* ML to optimize GNSS frequency of wakeup.
* ML to predict Survey parameters/nodes inventory ...etc
* Noise attenuation
* Data interpolation
