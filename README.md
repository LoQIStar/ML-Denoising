STRYDE ML Approaches / challenges

to summarise, we briefly introduced the STRYDE technology to LP and the STRYDE team suggested few areas that could be useful to explore with ML tools, ideas listed below:
* Noise detection
* Tilt detection
* Quality of the sensor (bad sensor) using metadata to come up with a better pass/fail
* Clockdrift correction using ML, build a clock drift model using the GNSSS on (ignore GNSS fixes to train the model)
* ML to optimize GNSS frequency of wakeup.
* ML to predict Survey parameters/nodes inventory ...etc
* Noise attenuation
* Data interpolation
 
these ideas have different level of complexity and we are looking for something that can be delivered ( an a POC) in few months time rather than a fully fleshed project.
so once Ben and Tom have digested the context we can discuss the complexity of each proposal and select the most likely to work in this context.
 
we don’t have an ML experts as such at Stryde so we won’t be able to run this project from scratch, we are more expecting a “working prototype” which we can improve with time. having said that, I am sure we will be able to give you a very good guidance and assist on the data and analysis side,  …
